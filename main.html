    <h2>Company Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Bahl Homes is a family owned and operated business. Bahl Homes has developed a business philosophy that centers on the basic belief that customers deserve the best. Our emphasis on customer service has allowed us to maintain and grow our customer base by way of referral and repeat business. We would love the chance to work for you! Whether you need a Mortgage Broker, Real Estate Agent, or General Contracting, we can help you.</p>
    <h2>Company Profile</h2>
      <p>Bahl Homes started out as a single family home tract developer and builder. We built our first homes in San Jose at the corner of Cherry and Hillsdale in 1963. Since then, we have built 650 homes in the South Bay including single family homes, custom homes, townhomes and zero lot line.</p>
      <p> Although the days of building tract housing are long gone in Santa Clara County, the experience Bahl Homes gained will prove invaluable when we apply it to your individual need.</p>
